Small Business Website With User Accounts

This web app allows even a small business to have a content management system that persists the data of its customers through a useful, password-protected interface.

There are a lot of links to make sure customers know how to navigate the website easily.

Note: This is meant mostly for small businesses that offer services rather than products but it can be adapted.

Small Business Website With User Accounts

This web app allows even a small business to have a content management system that persists the data of its customers through a useful, password-protected interface.

There are a lot of links to make sure customers know how to navigate the website easily.

Note: This is meant mostly for small businesses that offer services rather than products but it can be adapted.

8. Prepare a short video demo (narration helps!) describing how a user would interact with your working application.
9. Write a blog post about the project and process.
10. When done, submit your GitHub repo's url, a link to your video demo, and a link to your blog post in the corresponding text boxes in the right rail. Hit "I'm done" to wrap it up.

Unlike the rest of the curriculum, if you have any questions about your assessment or need help with it, please *don’t* use the Ask New Question feature. Rather than working with Learn Experts, please reach out to your Learn Instructor responsible for this section instead

## If you're a Learn-Verified Premium student:

We'll send an email to you soon to schedule a pairing process. If you don't hear from us in 48 hours after submission, get in touch!

### Be Prepared to:

1. Confirm your application meets the requirements above. We'll go through your app and ask you to show us how it meets the requirements above. 5-10 mins.
2. Explain your code from execution point to exit point. We're making sure you wrote it and understand how it works. 10-15 mins.
3. Live coding, doing a refactoring exercise to make sure you're comfortable working with your code. 10-15 mins.

### What to expect from the pairing session

Project reviews are focused on preparing you for technical interviews. Treat project reviews as if they were technical interviews, in both attitude and technical presentation. 

#### Be scrappy.
- If you make a mistake, correct yourself. 
- Think on your feet. We will expect you to be able to explain development concepts to us, as well as expanding on concepts that you have already implemented, but you’ll also have the opportunity to look things up while you're live coding.

#### Make no little plans.
- You're going to learn a ton. We will give pointers and show you ways to improve your code. This isn't telling you that your code is wrong, it's simply us teaching. 
- Approach live coding with a constructive attitude. You might feel nervous or uncertain, but as long as you are familiar with the section material you should be able to reason your way to a solution.
- Be proud of your project and your code, and show confidence in it. 

#### Radiate positivity.
- Present yourself and your project in the best way possible. 
- Be open to feedback, both positive and constructive. 
- If the instructor asks you to complete additional features, or you missed a project requirement, treat this as a learning experience. Becoming  a developer is complex and challenging, and it’s our job to find the holes in your knowledge and help you fill them. This is to help you become a better developer, not to delay your progress in the program.

#### Work Together.
- Trust yourself.
- Trust us  - our goal is to help you be successful in achieving your goals.
- We understand that this process can be stressful. We’re here to help you through.

#### Pursue mastery.
- Use the best technical vocabulary you can.
- Explain the details - this is your application, you'll be expected to have a solid understand of how it works"
- Ask questions! Curiosity and willingness to learn are hugely valued in our industry.  If you haven’t heard of something, that’s okay - use this opportunity to learn about it!


### What won't happen:

- You won't be told you're ever wrong
- You won't be yelled at, belittled, or scolded
- You won't be put on the spot without support
- There's nothing you can do to instantly fail or blow it.
